## Length in bytes for primitive types

| Data Type | Size    | Description                              |
|-----------|---------|------------------------------------------|
| byte      | 1 byte  | Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127    |
| short     | 2 bytes | Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767 |
| int       | 4 bytes | Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 |
| long      | 8 bytes | Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |
| float     | 4 bytes | Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits |
| double    | 8 bytes | Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits |
| boolean   | 1 bit   | Stores true or false values              |
| char      | 2 bytes | Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values |


## Keywords: static, final, transient, strictfp, volatile

**static** =  share the <u>same variable or method of a given class</u>. (variables, methods, blocks and nested classes). This (variable or method) is loaded in memory once at the time of class loading, so it saves memory, since it's not defined per object in Java. Static methods creates behaviour at the class level.  
Instance member variables cannot be accessed by a static method.
But an instance method can call both instance variables and static variables.  
**final** = define an entity that <u>can only be assigned once</u>. Once a final variable has been assigned, it always contains the same value. For classes, a final class will not be inherited (also methods).  
**transient** = used for a <u>member variable not to be serialized</u>. Instead of being serialized, the variable will be reduced to its default value (not considered part of the persistent state of the object).  
**strictfp** =  used for <u>restricting floating-point calculations</u> and ensuring same result on every platform while performing operations in the floating-point variable.  
**volatile** = another way (like synchronized, atomic wrapper) of making class thread safe (method or class instance can be used by multiple threads at the same time without any problem). Volatile variables have the visibility features of synchronized but not the atomicity features. The <u>values of volatile variable will never be cached</u> and all writes and reads will be done to and from the main memory. 


## Difference between final, finally and finalize

| final                                    | finally                                  | finalize                                 |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Final is used to apply restrictions on class, method and variable. Final class can't be inherited, final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed. | Finally is used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not. | Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected. |
| Final is a keyword.                      | Finally is a block.                      | Finalize is a method.                    |


## Default values for data types

**INSTANCE VARIABLES:**  

| Data Type                | Default Value (for fields) |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| byte                     | 0                          |
| short                    | 0                          |
| int                      | 0                          |
| long                     | 0L                         |
| float                    | 0.0f                       |
| double                   | 0.0d                       |
| char                     | '\u0000'                   |
| String (or any object)   | null                       |
| boolean                  | false                      |

**LOCAL VARIABLES**   ->   <u>Java does not initialize local variables with any default value</u> (will be null by default)


## Serialization

OBJECT DATA ->serialization -> STREAM OF BYTES ->deserialization -> OBJECT DATA

When an object is transferred through the network, the object needs to be 'serialized'. Serialization converts the object state to serial bytes (byte array) which represents the class, version and internal state of the object.

Purpose:
- communication
- persistence
- caching (improve object creation performance)
- cross JVM synchronization


## this' vs 'super'

***this***
- keyword refering to the current instance of the object
- useful for differentiating between instance varibles and local variables
- it can be used to call current class’s constructor(s)

***super*** 
- is used to call parent class’s constructor (i.e, Parent’s class)
- it can also call a method of parent class from a method of a child class

We cannot use both super() and this() in the same constructor.

<u>In Java, Object class is the superclass of every other class.</u>


## Access modifiers in Java

| Access Modifier                          | within class | within package | outside package by subclass only | outside package |
|------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| <b style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">Private | Y            | N              | N                                | N               |
| <b style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">Default | Y            | Y              | N                                | N               |
| <b style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">Protected | Y            | Y              | Y                                | N               |
| <b style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);">Public | Y            | Y              | Y                                | Y               |

!! protected will permit access to child classes even if they are in another package. Also will permit access to all classes within the same package.


## Mutable vs immutable object or class 

Immutable class means that once an object is created, we cannot change its content.

| Mutable                                  | Immutable                                |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Fields can be changed after the object creation | Fields cannot be changed after object creation. Immutability makes it easier to parallelize your program as there are no conflicts among objects. |
| Generally provides a method to modify the field value | Does not have any method to modify the field value |
| Has Getter and Setter methods            | Has only Getter method                   |
| **Example:** StringBuilder, java.util.Date   | **Example:** String, Boxed primitive objects (wrapper classes) like Integer, Long and etc |


## Immutable class creation

- class has <u>final modifier</u> (to prevent extension)
- fields are <u>private final</u> (to assign value only once)
- <u>no setter</u> methods for member variables
- use deep copy to initialize all the fields by a constructor
- clone() method should return a copy of object instead of the actual object reference

EXAMPLE:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
 
// An immutable class
public final class Student {
    private final String name;
    private final int regNo;
    private final Map<String, String> metadata;
 
    public Student(String name, int regNo, Map<String, String> metadata) {
        this.name = name;
        this.regNo = regNo;
        Map<String, String> tempMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (Map.Entry<String, String> entry : metadata.entrySet()) {
            tempMap.put(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue());
        }
        this.metadata = tempMap;
    }
 
    public String getName() { return name; }
 
    public int getRegNo() { return regNo; }
 
    public Map<String, String> getMetadata() {
        Map<String, String> tempMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (Map.Entry<String, String> entry : this.metadata.entrySet()) {
            tempMap.put(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue());
        }
        return tempMap;
    }
}
```


## StringBuffer vs StringBuilder vs String

Java provides three classes to represent a sequence of characters: 
- String, 
- StringBuffer 
- StringBuilder 

The String class is an immutable class whereas StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes are mutable.

- StringBuilder is more efficient (for processing operations) than StringBuffer, but it is not synchronized (not thread safe). 
- StringBuffer is thread safe. 
- String is the least efficient.


## float vs BigDecimal

- BigDecimal (base-10) is a class, float (base-2) is a primitive
- BigDecimal is able to represent very precise decimal values (when we really need accurate computations)
- BigDecimal will not round automatically, or loses precision (except 2/3)
- BigDecimal take up more memory
- BigDecimal are stored in heap (float in stack)
 
```java
BigDecimal bd1 = new BigDecimal("250.0005021");
BigDecimal bd2 = new BigDecimal("120.002");

BigDecimal sum = bd1.add(bd2);
BigDecimal sum2 = bd1.add(new BigDecimal("5.00"));
BigDecimal subtraction = bd1.subtract(bd2);
BigDecimal product = bd1.multiply(bd2);
BigDecimal division = bd1.divide(bd2);
System.out.println("Sum is: " + sum.toString());

float d = bd1.floatValue();
System.out.printf("Formated in two decimal d = %.2f", d);
```



## Nested classes

- Nested class = a class within another class
- nested class does not exists independently of outer class
- NC has access to all members of enclosing class (however the reverse is not true)
- NC is also a member of its enclosing class
- there are two type of nested classes:
    - static nested class: are declared static. In this case, without an outer class object existing, there may be a static nested class object. i.e., an object of a static nested class is not strongly associated with the outer class object.   `OuterClass.StaticNestedClass nestedObject = new OuterClass.StaticNestedClass();`  
    
    - inner class:  non-static nested class. To instantiate an inner class, you must first instantiate the outer class. Then, create the inner object within the outer object:  
    `OuterClass.InnerClass innerObject = outerObject.new InnerClass();`
      - member inner class
      - local inner class (access only constant local members)
      - anonymous inner class

- There can also be nested interfaces that are by default static


## Regular vs. static initialization blocks

```java
public class Test {
    {
        System.out.println("Empty block");
    }
    
    static {
        System.out.println("Static block");
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Test t = new Test();
    }
}
```
The static initializer block will be called on loading of the class, and will have no access to instance variables or methods.It is often used to create static variables. 

The non-static initializer block on the other hand is created on object construction only, will have access to instance variables and methods, and will be called at the beginning of the constructor, after the super constructor has been called (either explicitly or implicitly) and before any other subsequent constructor code is called. Used when a class has multiple constructors and needs the same initialization code called for all constructors. Just as with constructors, we should avoid calling non-final methods in this block.


## Autoboxing

**Autoboxing**: Converting a primitive value into an object of the corresponding wrapper class is called autoboxing. For example, converting int to Integer class. 

**Unboxing**: Converting an object of a wrapper type to its corresponding primitive value is called unboxing. For example conversion of Integer to int. 

- Autoboxing and unboxing lets developers write cleaner code, making it easier to read.
- The technique let us use primitive types and Wrapper class objects interchangeably and we do not need to perform any typecasting explicitly.

Autoboxing pitfalls:
- Performance
- Confused Equals
- Caching of Primitive by Wrapper Classes
- Ambiguous Method Calls


## Java object references

A reference is an address that indicates where an object's variables and methods are stored.  
```Example a = new Example();```  
here a is actually a reference which is pointing to memory assigned (in heap) using new keyword.  


## What is deep copy of a Java object

**Deep copy** of an object will have exact copy of all the fields of original object just like shallow copy. But in additional, if original object has any references to other objects as fields, then copy of those objects are also created by calling clone() method on them.

A **shallow copy** is one in which we only copy values of fields from one object to another (and keep references to other objects from fields).


## What is Lambda expression (Java 8)

A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value. Lambda expressions are similar to methods, but they do not need a name and they can be implemented right in the body of a method.

```java
numbers.forEach( (n) -> { 
                            System.out.println(n); 
                        } );
```

## What is a parameterized or generic type

- A generic type is a type with formal type parameters. A generic type is a reference type that has one or more type parameters. These type parameters are later replaced by type arguments when the generic type is instantiated (or declared ). 

```java
interface Collection<E>  { 
  public void add (E x); 
  public Iterator<E> iterator();
}
```

- A parameterized type is an instantiation of a generic type with actual type arguments.

```java
Collection<String> coll = new LinkedList<String>();
```

## What is JSON Data Binding

- The process of converting JSON data to a POJO and from object, back to JSON.
- Also known:
    - Mapping;
    - Serialization/Deserialization
    - Marshalling/Unmarshalling


## JDK, JRE, JVM

- **JDK** - **Java Development Kit** 
    - tools
    - libraries
    - compilers  (converts Java code into bytecode, that can be interpreted by JVM)
    - debuggers
- **JRE** - **Java Runtime Environment** 
    - libraries
    - JVM (required to run a Java program)
    - It is contained into JDK
- **JVM** - **Java Virtual Machine** 
    - abstract machine that executes Java Bytecode
    - It is platform dependent 
    - Includes JIT (just in time compiler) - used for performance improvement by compiling at execution time rather earlier


## Garbage collection

Java has an internal mechanism called Garbage collection to reclaim the memory of unused projects at run time. In Java, there are no pointers. Memory management and allocation is done by JVM. Since memory allocation is automated, after some time JVM may go low on memory. At that time, JVM has to free memory from unused objects.

It is a daemon in JVM that monitors the memory usage and performs memory cleanup. Once JVM is low on memory, GC process finds the <u>unused objects that are not referenced by other objects</u>. These unused objects are cleaned up by Garbage Collector daemon in JVM.

An object can be Garbage Collected by JVM, if it is not reachable.
There are two cases for deciding eligibility of objects for Garbage
Collection:
1. An Object/instance that cannot be reached by a live thread.
2. A set of circularly referenced instances that cannot be reached by any other instance outside that set.


## Reflection, introspection

The name reflection is used to modify (describe) code which is able to inspect other code in the same system (or itself).

> The ability to inspect the code in the system and see object types is not reflection, but rather Type Introspection. Reflection is then the ability to make modifications at runtime by making use of introspection. The distinction is necessary here as some languages support introspection, but do not support reflection. One such example is C++.

For example, say you have an object of an unknown type in Java, and you would like to call a 'doSomething' method on it if one exists. Java's static typing system isn't really designed to support this unless the object conforms to a known interface, but using reflection, your code can look at the object and find out if it has a method called 'doSomething' and then call it if you want to.

So, to give you a code example of this in Java (imagine the object in question is foo) :

```java
Method method = foo.getClass().getMethod("doSomething", null); // introspect
method.invoke(foo, null); // reflection
```

One very common use case in Java is the usage with annotations. JUnit 4, for example, will use reflection to look through your classes for methods tagged with the **@Test** annotation, and will then call them when running the unit test.

Another example:

```java
// A simple Java program to demonstrate the use of reflection 
import java.lang.reflect.Method; 
import java.lang.reflect.Field; 
import java.lang.reflect.Constructor; 

// class whose object is to be created 
class Test 
{ 
	// creating a private field 
	private String s; 

	// creating a public constructor 
	public Test() { s = "GeeksforGeeks"; } 

	// Creating a public method with no arguments 
	public void method1() { 
		System.out.println("The string is " + s); 
	} 

	// Creating a public method with int as argument 
	public void method2(int n) { 
		System.out.println("The number is " + n); 
	} 

	// creating a private method 
	private void method3() { 
		System.out.println("Private method invoked"); 
	} 
} 

class Demo 
{ 
	public static void main(String args[]) throws Exception 
	{ 
		// Creating object whose property is to be checked 
		Test obj = new Test(); 

		// Creating class object from the object using 
		// getclass method 
		Class cls = obj.getClass(); 
		System.out.println("The name of class is " + cls.getName()); 

		// Getting the constructor of the class through the 
		// object of the class 
		Constructor constructor = cls.getConstructor(); 
		System.out.println("The name of constructor is " + constructor.getName()); 

		System.out.println("The public methods of class are : "); 

		// Getting methods of the class through the object 
		// of the class by using getMethods 
		Method[] methods = cls.getMethods(); 

		// Printing method names 
		for (Method method:methods) 
			System.out.println(method.getName()); 

		// creates object of desired method by providing the 
		// method name and parameter class as arguments to 
		// the getDeclaredMethod 
		Method methodcall1 = cls.getDeclaredMethod("method2", int.class); 

		// invokes the method at runtime 
		methodcall1.invoke(obj, 19); 

		// creates object of the desired field by providing 
		// the name of field as argument to the 
		// getDeclaredField method 
		Field field = cls.getDeclaredField("s"); 

		// allows the object to access the field irrespective 
		// of the access specifier used with the field 
		field.setAccessible(true); 

		// takes object and the new value to be assigned 
		// to the field as arguments 
		field.set(obj, "JAVA"); 

		// Creates object of desired method by providing the 
		// method name as argument to the getDeclaredMethod 
		Method methodcall2 = cls.getDeclaredMethod("method1"); 

		// invokes the method at runtime 
		methodcall2.invoke(obj); 

		// Creates object of the desired method by providing 
		// the name of method as argument to the 
		// getDeclaredMethod method 
		Method methodcall3 = cls.getDeclaredMethod("method3"); 

		// allows the object to access the method irrespective 
		// of the access specifier used with the method 
		methodcall3.setAccessible(true); 

		// invokes the method at runtime 
		methodcall3.invoke(obj); 
	} 
}
```
