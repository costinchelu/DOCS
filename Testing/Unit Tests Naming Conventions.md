### Test Methods Naming Convention

**MethodName_GivenConditions_WhenThisHappens_ThenThisisExpectedResult**   
  
Example: sumOfTwoNumbers_givenTwoPositiveNumbers_WhenNumbersArePositive_ThenResultIsPositive()  
  
The method names may get long but conveys the full meaning of the test and is self-documenting.  
  
Avoid using defect numbers as part of the test method name. We can add a comment   
above the test method name that it was added as part of some defect # resolution.
  
Including the method name as part of the test case name may seem redundant but it is useful to  
sort tests by name within eclipse & also view in reports generated by Continuous Integration.
