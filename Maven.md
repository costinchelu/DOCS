# MAVEN

- build tool
- dependency management

- projects described by a POM (Project Object Model) stored in XML format

- build life cycle - made in phases

- lists dependencies
- unit test reports, including coverage
- integration test reports

- Maven is a collection of plugins (jar files) downloaded when needed from a cental repository to a local cache

### TERMIONOLOGY

- **ARCHETYPES** = templates -> convenient way to generate a new project
- **SNAPSHOT** = jar, war files are subjected to changes
- **MAVEN COORDINATE** = GroupId + ArtifactId + Version  
     - groupId = name of the group fo project (ex. ro.costin)
     - artifactId = name of the project (ex. mavenproject)
     - version = project's version. Keeping SNAPSHOT in name means it is not for release yet
     - package = java package name

### COMMAND LINE GENERATION OF A PROJECT

QUICKSTART ARCHETYPE = creates a standard Maven Project

![Tree structure for a QuickStart Archetype](images/Maven/tree_structure_quickstart_archetype.png)

### STANDARD MAVEN DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

![Standard Maven Directory Layout](images/Maven/standard_maven_dir_layout.png)

- src = source code  
- Target = contains artefacts generated by the build process (compiled sources, generated files)  
- test = unit tests
- it = integration tests

### POM (Project Object Model)

![POM Content](images/Maven/pom_content.png)

- pom.xml from the project inherits from a *super pom* (default configuration file) and even if we have an empty project we can still compile and build it
- pom + super pom = effective pom

### PACKAGING

- produces jar (default), war etc

- example packaging for creating a war file (web app) instead of a default jar:  
  - `<packaging>war</packaging>`
  
  - but we also need to configure the maven-war-plugin:
  
```xml
<packaging>war</packaging>

  <properties>
    <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
    <project.reporting.outputEncoding>UTF-8</project.reporting.outputEncoding>
  </properties>

  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-war-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.3.1</version>
        <configuration>
          <webXml>src\main\webapp\WEB-INF\web.xml</webXml>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
```
- in the above syntax we are giving details about war plugin version and the location of web.xml (configuration for our web app). Also we are defining a UTF-8 encoding for the project (to correct an error from the build phase)
- after that, Maven will create a war artefact in the *Target* folder
 
### LIFECYCLES

- CLEAN = everything in the Target folder is deleted (this can be customized)
- DEFAULT = BUILD = handles building and deployment
- SITE = creation of the project "site" documentation  
A build phase represents a stage in that particular lifecycle and the phase has a responsability to execute a goal:  

![Lifecycles Phase Bindings](images/Maven/lifecycles_bindings.png)

![Build phases](images/Maven/build_phases.png)

As an example we can assign the clean phase a plugin (*help*, with the goal *describe*): 
`mvn help:describe -Dcmd=clean`

![Example of running Maven Help plugin in the clean phase](images/Maven/example_clean_maven_help.png)

#### Execute goals

In IntelliJ - use *Execute Maven Goal* from Maven menu with the command `mvn help:describe -Dcmd=compile` . In this particular case we are invoking the help plugin with the describe goal. All will happen in compile (default) phase.

![Result of help:describe goal](images/Maven/result_help_plugin.png)

In the phase *Compile* we have a goal of compiling the plugin. The process (default phase) has 23 phases. Some have a bounded goal, some don't have any goal defined. To compile we can use maven compiler plugin with the `mvn compiler:compile`. If we get an error like: *Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin:3.1:compile (default-cli) on project ... : Compilation failure* we can set compiler plugin in pom.xml:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.8.1</version>
        <configuration>
          <source>11</source>
          <target>11</target>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```
In this case, because we are running just the goal (compile) and not the whole compile phase, only this goal will run. Also we can run more than one goal (concatenation) (all phases:goals will be written one after another separated by space).
Ex: `mvn clean:clean compiler:compile compiler:testCompile javadoc:javadoc surefire:test`

#### Execute Phases

Example: `clean test` = will run the clean, resources, compile, resources for the test, compile tests, run tests. Clean phase will not run if not specified because it resides in a different lifecycle (clean lifecycle) than test (which belongs to default lifecycle).  So that will run every phase in the default order until (and including) test phase (with the test goal).
`clean install` = will run same phases and also package (jar or war) and install in the local repository (User_dir\.m2\repository).
