# MAVEN

- build tool
- dependency management

- projects described by a POM (Project Object Model) stored in XML format

- build life cycle - made in phases

- lists dependencies
- unit test reports, including coverage
- integration test reports

- Maven is a collection of plugins (jar files) downloaded when needed from a cental repository to a local cache

### TERMIONOLOGY

- **ARCHETYPES** = templates -> convenient way to generate a new project
- **SNAPSHOT** = jar, war files are subjected to changes
- **MAVEN COORDINATE** = GroupId + ArtifactId + Version  
     - groupId = name of the group fo project (ex. ro.costin)
     - artifactId = name of the project (ex. mavenproject)
     - version = project's version. Keeping SNAPSHOT in name means it is not for release yet
     - package = java package name

### COMMAND LINE GENERATION OF A PROJECT

QUICKSTART ARCHETYPE = creates a standard Maven Project

![Tree structure for a QuickStart Archetype](images/Maven/tree_structure_quickstart_archetype.png)

### STANDARD MAVEN DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

![Standard Maven Directory Layout](images/Maven/standard_maven_dir_layout.png)

- src = source code  
- Target = contains artefacts generated by the build process (compiled sources, generated files)  
- test = unit tests
- it = integration tests

### POM (Project Object Model)

![POM Content](images/Maven/pom_content.png)

- pom.xml from the project inherits from a *super pom* (default configuration file) and even if we have an empty project we can still compile and build it
- pom + super pom = effective pom

### PACKAGING

- produces jar (default), war etc

- example packaging for creating a war file (web app) instead of a default jar:  
  - `<packaging>war</packaging>`
  
  - but we also need to configure the maven-war-plugin:
  
```xml
<packaging>war</packaging>

  <properties>
    <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
    <project.reporting.outputEncoding>UTF-8</project.reporting.outputEncoding>
  </properties>

  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-war-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.3.1</version>
        <configuration>
          <webXml>src\main\webapp\WEB-INF\web.xml</webXml>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
```
- in the above syntax we are giving details about war plugin version and the location of web.xml (configuration for our web app). Also we are defining a UTF-8 encoding for the project (to correct an error from the build phase)
- after that, Maven will create a war artefact in the *Target* folder
 
### LIFECYCLES

- CLEAN = everything in the Target folder is deleted (this can be customized)
- DEFAULT = BUILD = handles building and deployment
- SITE = creation of the project "site" documentation  
A build phase represents a stage in that particular lifecycle and the phase has a responsabilit to execute a goal:  

![Build phases](images/Maven/build_phases.png)

As an example we can assign the clean phase a plugin: 
`mvn help:describe -Dcmd=clean`

![Example of running Maven Help plugin in the clean phase](images/Maven/example_clean_maven_help.png)

In IntelliJ - use *Execute Maven Goal* from Maven menu with the command `mvn help:describe -Dcmd=compile`

![Result of help:describe goal](images/Maven/result_help_plugin.png)

In the phase *Compile* we have a goal of compiling the plugin. The process (default phase) has 23 phases. Some have a bounded goal, some don't have any goal defined.
